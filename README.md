## Interface Programming 1
**Intro to Front-end Web Development**

ART 128 Interface Programming 1 provides a foundation of skills, techniques, and principles necessary for students to create visually effective user-friendly web sites. Through lessons, demonstrations, and hands-on exercises, this course aims to develop skills in writing HTML (hypertext markup language), CSS (cascading style sheets), and JavaScript in pursuit of creating web standard compliant web sites.

*6 hours lecture/lab per week*

**Prerequisite(s):** *Art 112 with a grade of "C" or higher and satisfactory completion of the Interface Programming portfolio review or acceptance into a NMA AS specialization.*




## Course Objectives & Competencies
Upon successful completion of ART 128, the student should be able to:
- Apply basic concepts and principles of the front-end interface programming technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the creation of web-standard compliant websites.
- Analyze and evaluate the source code of existing websites for the use of well-formed, semantic markup, cross-platform/cross-browser compatibility, validation, and accessibility issues.
- Apply knowledge of the theory, history, and principles of interface design in the creation new media art.
- Apply successful problem-solving skills utilizing industry standard applications, technologies, and techniques in the creative and technical production process.
- Communicate effectively, both visually and verbally, by presenting work, defending design decisions, and by participating as an active critic during group critiques.
- Synthesize the concepts and principles of interface design with interface programming in the creation of web sites that integrates conceptual thinking, technical execution, and aesthetic application.


## Course Content
The general framework for this course is determined by the stages of the creative web design process for web design projects, consisting of defining, drafting, designing, developing, and delivering web sites.

This course addresses the final two stages of this process:

1. ~~**The Definition Phase** (i.e. defining the project)~~
1. ~~**The Drafting Phase** (i.e. drafting conceptual plans such as a site maps, wireframes, etc).~~
1. ~~**The Design Phase** (i.e. designing the user interface (UI) via design mockups)~~
1. **The Development Phase** (i.e. coding the front-end of the site via HTML & CSS)
1. **The Due Diligence Phase** (i.e. testing the site to ensure quality assurance)


## Topics addressed & content
- Intro to Intermediate front-end web development (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.
- Separating content from style/presentation using HTML and CSS.
- Manually hand-coding well-formed, semantic HTML, including proper use of titles, headings, lists, id's, and classes without the use of a WYSIWYG editor.
- Interface programming topics including CSS for layout/positioning (normal flow, absolute positioning, relative positioning, floating, etc), cross-browser compatibility, accessibility, and code validation.
- Interface programming techniques for common interface elements and design patterns including CSS pseudo classes (hover/rollover states), navigation and menu styles (styling lists), image replacement (IR), and controlling HTML/DHTML via Javascript/DOM scripting.
- Critical analysis of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code used on contemporary Web sites.
- Going through the full design process of converting a visual interface design into a working, interactive interface.
- Quality Assurance Testing - problem-solving and troubleshooting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by reading, understanding, and editing the code. Demonstrating an expanded vocabulary and an understanding of the importance of good front-end practices by presenting work, speaking about it articulately, defending coding decisions, and by participating as an active critic during group critiques.
- Synthesize all of the concepts and principles of front-end interface programming by creating websites that are robust, flexible, adaptable, and easy to maintain.


## Texts
There are no required texts for this course. Readings will be supplied by the instructor on a week to week basis, in either paper handout form or online.
Recommended, but not required texts:

- **HTML & CSS: Visual QuickStart Guide, 8th Edition.**
   by Elizabeth Castro.

- **Designing With Web Standards, 3rd Edition.**
   by Jeffrey Zeldman and Ethan Marcotte.

- **HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites**
   by Jon Duckett.


## Materials
All students are required to have hosting space to post their assignments, internship documentation, and ultimately their final presentation. Students are required to purchase a hosting plan with a third party hosting provider. Past students have purchased hosting plans from hosting providers such as Bluehost and GoDaddy (these are just a few of many hosting providers available). Plans should include ample disk space (ie. more than 2GB or unlimited), support for CGI, PHP, and MySQL, multiple domain hosting (to host more than one site), one-click install/support for popular CMS options (Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, etc), and a low, competitive price (an example rate is around $3-$5/month – this is subject to change based upon current trends for hosting prices).

Additional materials may include an external hard drive or thumbnail drive with a minimum
capacity of 4 GB.


## Instructor's Expectation:
Attendance and online class participation are important to succeed in this course. It is essential that you attend both face-to-face class meetings, arrive promptly, and remain for the full duration of the scheduled class periods. Time outside of class and at your internship location is required in order to meet the requirements of the class. All assignments are due by posting them online by the specified due date/time as specified on course schedule.
